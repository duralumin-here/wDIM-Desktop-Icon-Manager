# wDIM: A Simple Way to Manage Desktop Icons
Welcome to the ***wDIM documentation!*** This is where I explain how wDIM works. If you're unfamiliar with wDIM, [read about it here!](https://github.com/duralumin-here/wDIM-Desktop-Icon-Manager/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#wdim-a-simple-way-to-manage-desktop-icons)

## Quick Start Guide
Getting set up with wDIM is easy! Just follow these three steps:
1. **Make an icon set:** Follow [the icon set guidelines](https://github.com/duralumin-here/wDIM-Desktop-Icon-Manager/blob/master/docs/icon-sets.md#what-is-an-icon-set) to set one up—if you use the default icon feature, you can have a working set even if you only have one icon! You can also use [the arrow maker](https://github.com/duralumin-here/wDIM-Desktop-Icon-Manager/blob/master/docs/shortcut-arrows.md#using-the-arrow-editor) to quickly create a matching arrow and save it to your set.
2. **Prepare the desktop:** Use the [validate desktop and initialize desktop tools](https://github.com/duralumin-here/wDIM-Desktop-Icon-Manager/blob/master/docs/preparing-desktop.md) to set up your desktop for icon sets. If you have administrator privileges, you may also want to [initialize the arrow path](https://github.com/duralumin-here/wDIM-Desktop-Icon-Manager/blob/master/docs/shortcut-arrows.md#applying-custom-arrows) so custom arrows will show.
3. **Apply your set:** [Navigate to the icon set menu, import your set, select it and apply it!](https://github.com/duralumin-here/wDIM-Desktop-Icon-Manager/blob/master/docs/icon-sets.md)

It's as simple as that! But don't forget about [the label customizer](https://github.com/duralumin-here/wDIM-Desktop-Icon-Manager/blob/master/docs/labels.md)—you can use it at any time to give your shortcuts some extra flair.
