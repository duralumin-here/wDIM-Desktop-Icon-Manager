# ✒️ Labels
Shortcuts on the desktop, like any other files, can be renamed. The label tool allows you to rename shortcuts all at once (for the most part; see my note about [the private and public desktop](https://github.com/duralumin-here/wDIM-Desktop-Icon-Manager/blob/master/docs/preparing-desktop.md#the-public-and-private-desktops)).

## Choosing a Font
This program doesn't change the font used to render the names of the files; rather, it renames them using other characters to get the appearance of 𝐟𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐲 𝐭𝐞𝐱𝐭 ("fancy text"). You can select from any of the fonts included, and each shortcut will be renamed individually. Selecting a font will bring up a preview of it.

## Adding Text
You can also add extra text to the start or end of every shortcut: just check off the checkbox for the setting and type in the text you'd like to add. If you uncheck the box, its text won't be applied even if there's still text in the textbox. Here's a neat trick: hold the Windows key and the period (or "full-stop," if you're not American) key at the same time to use emojis!

## Applying and Removing Labels
Once you've made your selection, use the *apply new labels* button to apply the settings you've selected. Use the *restore original labels* button to revert them back to what they originally were. [(Either of these processes may be interrupted if shortcuts are on the public desktop and the application isn't running with administrator privileges.)](https://github.com/duralumin-here/wDIM-Desktop-Icon-Manager/blob/master/docs/preparing-desktop.md#the-public-and-private-desktops)
