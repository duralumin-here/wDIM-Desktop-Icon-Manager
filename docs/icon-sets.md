# 💫 Icon Sets
The heart of wDIM! Icon sets allow you to define icons, a shortcut arrow, and a wallpaper that can be applied all at once with the press of a button.

## What *is* an Icon Set?
An icon set isn't anything fancy: it's just a folder with a few specific types of files named in a specific way. Icon sets can have any or all of the following:
- **Icons:** [During path initialization, icon paths are set to wDIM's "Current-Icons" folder and named based on the shortcut's target.](https://github.com/duralumin-here/wDIM-Desktop-Icon-Manager/blob/master/docs/preparing-desktop.md#initializing-icon-paths) wDIM doesn't continuously rewrite icon paths; rather, it simply changes the images stored at those paths in order to change the appearance of their associated shortcuts.
  - *Specific icons:* wDIM only "knows" that an icon goes with a certain shortcut if it's named after its target. So if one of the shortcuts on your desktop is to "firefox.exe", wDIM will check that the set you're applying contains a "firefox.ico" icon. If it does, it will automatically show [as long as you initialized the paths as outlined in the Preparing the Desktop section.](https://github.com/duralumin-here/wDIM-Desktop-Icon-Manager/blob/master/docs/preparing-desktop.md#initializing-icon-paths)
  - *Default icons:* When a specific icon isn't found for a file, wDIM will look for a default icon (any icon with the word "default" in its name) in the set to use instead. You can have any number of default icons in a set, but if the set doesn't contain at least one, then any shortcut that doesn't have a specifically assigned icon won't have any icon at all. If wDIM cannot find the "firefox.ico" icon for your "firefox.exe" shortcut, wDIM will check for any default icons in the set—if there are multiple, it'll just choose one of them. wDIM will then make a copy of it named "firefox.ico" so the "firefox.exe" shortcut will have its icon to display.
- **Wallpaper:** An image file named "wallpaper"; if there are multiple, the order of precedence is "wallpaper.png" > "wallpaper.jpeg" > "wallpaper.jpg" > "wallpaper.bmp" > "wallpaper.gif", with "wallpaper.png" taking highest precedence and "wallpaper.gif" taking lowest precedence. This can be applied to the desktop.
- **Arrow:** An icon named "arrow.ico" that will show in the lower left corner of shortcuts. Note that the arrow.ico file will only be effective if you've [initialized the arrow path](https://github.com/duralumin-here/wDIM-Desktop-Icon-Manager/blob/master/docs/shortcut-arrows.md#applying-custom-arrows); this is separate from initializing the shortcut icon paths.
- **Details:** You can include a "details.txt" file with any text you want, perhaps including a description of the set and whoever created it. This will only show on the icon sets tab and has no further effects.
 
## Viewing Icon Sets
The *icon sets* tab of wDIM allows you to quickly view and apply icon sets. You can import icon sets with the *import button* (or move them to the Icon-Sets folder [within the app folder yourself](https://github.com/duralumin-here/wDIM-Desktop-Icon-Manager/blob/master/docs/settings.md#viewing-the-app-folder) if you're careful); selecting one from the list will show its saved icons in a scrollable list, its wallpaper in the top rectangular box, the shortcut arrow in the corner of the wallpaper (hover it for easier visibility), and details in the lower rectangular box. Any elements not contained in the set won't show up.

## Applying Icon Sets
Hitting the *apply icon set* button will apply the selected icons, wallpaper, and arrow as described above. If you turned off the default setting that [automatically applies wallpapers in icon sets,](https://github.com/duralumin-here/wDIM-Desktop-Icon-Manager/blob/master/docs/settings.md#automatically-applying-wallpapers) they won't do so; if the icon set doesn't contain a wallpaper and you've [set a default wallpaper yourself](https://github.com/duralumin-here/wDIM-Desktop-Icon-Manager/blob/master/docs/settings.md#setting-a-default-wallpaper), the default wallpaper will be applied. If the custom arrow doesn't show, make sure you've [initialized the arrow path.](https://github.com/duralumin-here/wDIM-Desktop-Icon-Manager/blob/master/docs/shortcut-arrows.md#applying-custom-arrows)

The desktop will automatically refresh once the set is applied; Windows Explorer will restart as well [if you've set it to do so,](https://github.com/duralumin-here/wDIM-Desktop-Icon-Manager/blob/master/docs/settings.md#restarting-windows-explorer-automatically) but I don't believe this is a setting you should need and I only include it for troubleshooting purposes.

When a new icon set is applied, the Current-Icons folder (a folder in the app folder that holds icons currently in use; shortcut icon paths and the arrow path point it to after initialization) is copied to "Most-Recent-Icons-Backup" before "Current-Icons" is cleared and refilled with the new icons. True to its name, "Most-Recent-Icons-Backup" only holds the most recent copy of Current-Icons. To illustrate, imagine I apply Icon Set 1. If I later apply Icon Set 2, "Most-Recent-Icons-Backup" will hold what "Current-Icons" held for Icon Set 1. Then, if I apply Icon Set 3, "Most-Recent-Icons-Backup" will only hold what "Current-Icons" was for Icon Set 2. Thus, "Most-Recent-Icons-Backup" stays one set behind. You likely won't need this, but it's just an extra safeguard against accidental data loss.

## Reverting Icon Sets
Before you initialize the icon set paths, a backup of your desktop shortcuts is automatically saved. If you decide you no longer want to use custom icons, the easiest way to go back is to simply delete the offending shortcuts from your desktop and replace them with older backups (which can be founded in the Saved-Backups folder of [the app folder](https://github.com/duralumin-here/wDIM-Desktop-Icon-Manager/blob/master/docs/settings.md#viewing-the-app-folder)). I suggest you [manually make a backup of the desktop yourself](https://github.com/duralumin-here/wDIM-Desktop-Icon-Manager/blob/master/docs/preparing-desktop.md#backing-up-shortcuts) before doing this, just in case.
